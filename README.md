#Item Tracker

This is a little project for the lecture "Scaleable Webarchitectures".

##Intro

Your goal is to create a system that is used to track the inventory of a larger corporation. They run many offices in multiple locations and want to know how many pencils, staplers, computers, etc. they have in each of these locations.

As a good SOA developer your solution should come in 4 services:

* A user management system
* An item tracking system
* A system to manage the different locations
* A reporting system
